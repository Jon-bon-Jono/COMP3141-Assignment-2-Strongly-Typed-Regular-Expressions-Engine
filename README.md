# COMP3141-Assignment-2-Strongly-Typed-Regular-Expressions-Engine
Implementation of a strongly typed regular expressions engine using GADTs and a number of additional convenience combinators for working with regular expressions in Haskell. Intended to give experience with Haskell type system extensions (specifically GADTs), programming with monads and applicative functors.

- Hare.hs: 
- Untyped.hs: untyped, unextended version of the regex engine
